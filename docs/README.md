This project includes two important documentation files: `DESIGN.md` and `ALGORITHM.md`. Below is a brief overview of each:

---

### **`DESIGN.md`**
- **Purpose**: Describes the system's architecture and the relationships between components like Virtual Memory, Physical Memory, Page Table, and TLB.
- **Key Points**:
  - Overview of system components.
  - Details of data structures.
  - Workflow of memory management, including address translation and page replacement.
  - Design decisions behind component interaction.

---

### **`ALGORITHM.md`**
- **Purpose**: Focuses on the algorithms used for page and TLB replacement in the virtual memory system.
- **Key Points**:
  - FIFO.
  - LRU.
  - OPT.
